Additional Comments, Suggestions, Feedback:

#### Feedback:  
the landing page on this application is beautifu;. Very well done from a design
<br> perspective. The app itself is missing some crucial functionality. It seems I can only follow
<br> two links, "Dog" & "Cat", which then bring me to a 'comment' form. The comments can only be created 
<br> and not deleted, or updated. I thought you and Albert had some form or another of this app working
<br> last Thursday, no? In addition, your wire frames & ERD are not in the read me file, or trello. Be sure to include
<br> those, even though I remember you presenting them the other week. Finally, be sure to make use of the tools, like <br> trello, to help keep your end goal in sight. Great job including the heroku link though!
